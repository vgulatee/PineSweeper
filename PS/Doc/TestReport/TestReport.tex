\section{Changes Due to Testing}
The implementation was previously drawing the grid with contents of cell (number, pine mine and empty space) using JPanel draw tools,
which would offset the orientation of the grid from the window. While testing disable button functionality for flag, we discovered that the
outline of the button resembles the grid revealed when the cell registered a left click. Hence, the implementation was changed such that
the button component of cell was assigned an icon to be revealed as it is disabled, based on the content of the button.\\

On reviewing the results of survey testing, one suggestion given to us was that instead of implementing pause game functionality as it was done in the reference application JSweeper (registering pause and resume when an action was performed outside of game window), we should introduce a pause/resume button for the user to use.\\

Visual themes Slate Gray and Rose Garden Pink were added based on suggestions made by survey testers.\\

\section{Code Coverage Metrics}
While testing \textit{PineSweeper}, JUNIT testing was used to test code. The main testing was done to our backend code as the
GUI was manually tested. The backend code is mainly contained in the \textit{JSweepGameControl} and \textit{Cell} classes.
